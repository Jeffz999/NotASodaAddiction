HOMEMADE CITRUS SODA - ENHANCED RECIPE
(With Oleo Saccharum Base)

INGREDIENTS:

Base Mixture (Oleo Saccharum):
- 5 fresh limes
- 3 fresh lemons
- 1 fresh orange
- 1.5 cups granulated sugar (for peel mix)
- 2 tablespoons honey
- Tiny pinch of salt (3-4 grains only)

Flavor Enhancers:
- 1 teaspoon citric acid powder
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons warm water (for citric acid solution)

Extras:
- Soda water (chilled)
- Optional: 2 scoops caffeine per liter

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Peel Preparation (Day 1):
   - Carefully peel all citrus fruits (limes, lemons, and orange)
   - Focus on getting just the colored part, avoiding white pith which can add bitterness
   - Keep peeled fruits for juicing later
   - Collect all peels in a non-reactive bowl (glass or ceramic preferred)

2. Oleo Saccharum Setup (Day 1):
   - Add 1.5 cups sugar to the peels
   - Sprinkle the tiny pinch of salt
   - Add honey
   - Gently muddle peels to release oils
   - Cover bowl with plastic wrap
   - Let sit for 24 hours at room temperature

3. Citric Acid Solution Preparation (Day 2):
   - Dissolve 1 teaspoon citric acid in 2 tablespoons warm water
   - Stir until completely dissolved
   - Set aside

4. Processing (Day 2):
   - Transfer the peel-sugar mixture to a saucepan
   - Add 1 cup water
   - Bring to a gentle simmer (small bubbles, not rolling boil)
   - Reduce heat to low immediately
   - Let reduce for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally
   - Watch for slight thickening but avoid any browning
   - Remove from heat

5. Straining and Mixing:
   - Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer
   - Juice all the peeled citrus fruits
   - Add 50-75% of citrus juice to the strained syrup
   - Add vanilla extract
   - Add citric acid solution starting with half (taste and adjust)
   - Stir well to combine

6. Final Assembly:
   - Use approximately 1/3 cup of your syrup mixture per liter of soda water
   - Add optional caffeine if desired
   - Stir gently to combine
   - Taste and adjust:
     * More syrup for sweetness
     * More citric acid solution for tartness
     * More vanilla for roundness

STORAGE:
- Keep syrup base refrigerated in an airtight container
- Best used within 1 week
- Mix with soda water just before serving

SERVING SUGGESTIONS:
- Serve over ice
- Garnish with fresh citrus slices if desired
- Best consumed immediately after mixing with soda water
- Start with less syrup and add more to taste - everyone's preference differs

YIELD:
- Makes approximately enough syrup for 4 liters of soda

NOTES:
- Always start with less citric acid and vanilla - you can add more but can't take it out
- The syrup should taste slightly stronger than desired as it will be diluted with soda water
- If too sweet or tart, adjust by adding more soda water
- If not strong enough, increase syrup ratio
