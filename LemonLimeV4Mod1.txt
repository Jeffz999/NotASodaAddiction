   - Stir until completely dissolved
   - Set aside

4. Processing (Day 2):
   - Transfer the peel-sugar mixture to a saucepan
   - Add 1 cup water
   - Bring to a gentle simmer (small bubbles, not rolling boil)
   - Reduce heat to low immediately
   - Let reduce for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally
   - Watch for slight thickening but avoid any browning
   - Add honey and stir

     * More syrup for sweetness
     * More citric acid solution for tartness
     * More vanilla for roundness

STORAGE:
- Keep syrup base refrigerated in an airtight container
- Best used within 1 week

SERVING SUGGESTIONS:
- Serve over ice
- Garnish with fresh citrus slices if desired
- Best consumed immediately after mixing with soda water
- Start with less syrup and add more to taste - everyone's preference differs

YIELD:
- Makes approximately enough syrup for 4 liters of soda

NOTES:
- Always start with less citric acid and vanilla - you can add more but can't take it out
- The syrup should taste slightly stronger than desired as it will be diluted with soda water
- If too sweet or tart, adjust by adding more soda water
- If not strong enough, increase syrup ratio
