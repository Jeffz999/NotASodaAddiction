   - Collect all peels in a non-reactive bowl (glass or ceramic preferred)

2. Oleo Saccharum Setup (Day 1):
   - Add 1 cup sugar to the peels
   - Gently muddle peels to release oils
   - Cover bowl with plastic wrap
   - Let sit for 24 hours at room temperature

3. Citric Acid Solution Preparation (Day 2):
   - Dissolve 1/2 teaspoon citric acid in 1 tablespoon warm water
   - Stir until completely dissolved
   - Set aside

4. Initial Processing (Day 2):
   - Strain the oleo saccharum liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl THAT WILL NOT BURN
   - Set aside this strained liquid (contains pure oil-sugar essence)
   - Keep the used peels in the strainer temporarily
   - Note: Don't press/squeeze peels yet

   Secondary Extraction:
   - Heat 1 cup water to boil
   - Place the used peels in a heat-safe bowl
   - Pour the hot water over the peels
   - Stir gently for 30 seconds
   - Let reduce for 2 minutes
   - Strain this hot extraction through fine-mesh strainer
   - Gently press peels with back of spoon to release remaining liquid
   - Add honey and stir until dissolved while hot

   - Taste and adjust:
     * More syrup for sweetness
     * More citric acid solution for tartness
     * More vanilla for roundness

STORAGE:
- Keep syrup base refrigerated in an airtight container
- Best used within 1 week
- Mix with soda water just before serving

SERVING SUGGESTIONS:
- Serve over ice
- Garnish with fresh citrus slices if desired
- Best consumed immediately after mixing with soda water
- Start with less syrup and add more to taste - everyone's preference differs

YIELD:
- Makes approximately enough syrup for 4 liters of soda

NOTES:
- Always start with less citric acid and vanilla - you can add more but can't take it out
- The syrup should taste slightly stronger than desired as it will be diluted with soda water
- If too sweet or tart, adjust by adding more soda water
- If not strong enough, increase syrup ratio
