- Best consumed immediately after mixing with soda water
- Start with less syrup and add more to taste - everyone's preference differs

YIELD:

NOTES:
- Always start with less citric acid and vanilla - you can add more but can't take it out
- The syrup should taste slightly stronger than desired as it will be diluted with soda water
- If too sweet or tart, adjust by adding more soda water
- If not strong enough, increase syrup ratio
